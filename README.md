# CS559 - Computer Graphics (Fall 2016)
Starting with a basic 2D drawing and ending with a navigatable "world". Rendering code was `Created by gleicher on 10/9/2015.` for the purposes of the class; objects and path coordinates created by Steven Wiener (for the purposes of homework).

## Getting Started
- Launch `index.html` in the desired program folder.
  - `twgl-full-min.js` archived in case "http://graphics.cs.wisc.edu/JS/twgl-full.min.js" is removed.

#### Disclaimer (10.20.21)
In `/Final`, some of the image-generated graphics no longer work :'( not sure if it's because Adobe Flash Player (RIP) of if you need to launch on `localhost` or a server.
